Architecture:
    Our program is structured into modules, where each module contains
    a step for compression and the corresponding decompression step. In total,
    there are 5 modules corresponding with compression/decompression
    steps and 1 module for basic operations

5 Compression/Decompression Step Modules:

    -- RGBToFloats: used for used for converting values from their RGB values
                    in Pnm_rgb structs to their floating point values in
                    FloatingPoints structs and vice versa.

    -- RGBFloatsToCompVid: used for converting data from a component video
                           color space representation to a floating point
                           representation and vice versa.

    -- DiscreteCosTrans: used to perform discrete cosign and inverse discrete
                         cosign transformation given a sequence of Comp Video
                         structs or an array containing abcd (for inverse)

    -- ScaleABCD: Used to convert float values to quantized integers before
                  packaging them for compression, and converting the
                  quantized integers back to float values for
                  decompression

    -- Bitpack: Used to package and retrieve bits. In compression, used to
                create the unsigned integer word, and in decompression, used
                to retrieve both the word and to unpack the word and the
                variables within it

Basic Operations Module:
    -- changeNums: Used to edit and scale numbers whenever necessary in the
                   program. Contains a function for converting to an even
                   number and a function for clamping numbers. It also
                   contains functions to calculate the maximum and minimum
                   values that a given width of bits can store
